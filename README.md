# SDS-Q-A-service

For this project I was given a set of CSV files with millions of records for the 'Questions and Answers' section of an growing e-commerce website.
My job in this team was to replace an existing database and produce a scalable API that will that will be able to serve at least 200 clients per second with 50ms average response times.

While testing with loader.io (which is a load testing service that allows you to stress test your web aps by imitating clients connections) I was able to reach the goal.
